Firstly i checked few examples on internet related to shell in c.
We were asked to implement shell using fork(), exec and wait.
so i studied about this concept with the help of internet.
After that i implemented shell in c lang.
Then i tried to implement shell for pipe, grep like commands, but was unsuccessful.
Then few ours before the deadline i added some colours to my shell.
